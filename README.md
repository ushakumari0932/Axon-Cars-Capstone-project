Axon Sales Report
Description:
The "Axon Sales Report" project is a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) solution designed to address the data management and analysis challenges faced by Axon, a retailer specializing in classic cars. Axon is currently struggling to efficiently manage and gain meaningful insights from their sales data, leading to difficulties in decision-making processes. To overcome these challenges, this project leverages the capabilities of Microsoft PowerBI and SQL to create a robust BI system tailored to Axon's needs.

Key Features:
Data Integration: We utilize a MySQL database to store crucial business data, including customer details, product information, sales orders, and more.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: The project involves cleaning and transforming data to ensure accuracy, consistency, and readiness for analysis. This includes handling duplicates, missing values, and data consistency issues.
Interactive Dashboards: We leverage PowerBI to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards and reports that provide valuable insights into sales performance. These dashboards include charts, graphs, and tables.
Advanced Analytics: SQL is used to perform advanced analytics on sales data, extracting actionable insights to drive improvements in sales strategies and operations.
Real-time Access: The solution allows management to access up-to-date dashboards and reports in real-time, enabling data-driven decision-making.
Project Steps:
Data Setup: Create a MySQL database called "classicmodels" and load it into Power BI for analysis.
Data Transformation: Cleanse and transform data to ensure data quality.
Dashboard Design: Utilize PowerBI's capabilities to design intuitive dashboards and reports that provide a comprehensive view of sales data.
Advanced Analytics: Implement SQL queries for in-depth analysis and insight extraction.
Testing and Debugging: Thoroughly test the BI solution to ensure its functionality and address any issues.
Deployment: Deploy the BI solution to the sales team and management, ensuring user-friendliness and ease of adoption.
Deliverables:
SQL files: Share SQL scripts used for data analysis and advanced analytics.
Power BI report: Share the Power BI file containing the interactive dashboards and reports.
Outcome:
The successful implementation of this BI solution will empower Axon to make informed decisions, improve sales strategies, and ultimately enhance its overall business performance in the classic car retail industry.
